What is it?
===========

NetCDF95 is a Fortran interface to the
[NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/index.html)
library. Compared to the [Fortran 90 NetCDF
interface](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs-fortran/f90_The-NetCDF-Fortran-90-Interface-Guide.html),
the NetCDF95 interface is meant to be friendlier and more secure.
Notably, it frees you of the cumbersome task of handling the error
status.
